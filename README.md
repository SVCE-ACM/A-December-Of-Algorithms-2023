   #### Explanation
   ```
       1. "cat" to "cot":
             Only one letter changes ("a" to "o").
             This adheres to the rule that the words in the chain must differ by exactly one letter.
       2. "cot" to "dot":
             Again, only one letter changes ("c" to "d").
             The chain is still follows the rule of a single-letter difference between consecutive words.
       3. "dot" to "dog":
             Just like before, only one letter changes ("t" to "g").
       4. "dog" to "cog":
             Once more, only one letter changes ("d" to "c").

   ```
#### Sample Input/Output
   ```
     Input: ["apple", "orange", "banana", "grape", "peach"]
     Output: No valid chain.

### December 16 - Outbreak Dynamics

   #### Problem Statement
   In a grid representing a city, there are zombies and humans. Zombies can infect humans in adjacent cells (up, down, left, or right), turning them into zombies. However, zombies cannot cross obstacles represented by the value -1. Humans can move freely. Implement a function to calculate the minimum time it takes for the zombie infection to spread throughout the entire city. If it's not possible for the infection to spread to all humans, return -1.The city is represented as a 2D grid, where:

0 represents an empty cell (can be occupied by a human),
1 represents a cell with a zombie,
-1 represents an obstacle.


   <p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/SVCE-ACM/A-December-Of-Algorithms-2023/assets/113821083/a5fc5d69-b8a4-41dc-b59c-9009c31e9cb9"></p>

### December 17 - Bookshelf Dilemma

   #### Problem Statement
   Imagine you're a librarian in a busy city library. A visitor complains about confusing loops in certain book sections. Create a function called detectAndRemoveLoop(). Swiftly, you navigate the shelves, untangling and fixing loops. The books now sit neatly, providing an orderly reading experience for visitors. This tool proves invaluable in maintaining the library's organization. Create a linked list that detects and removes the loops.



   <p align="center"><img src = "https://github.com/SVCE-ACM/A-December-Of-Algorithms-2023/assets/153520105/3378af05-944d-4e9c-b3e1-cf53e5bccac9"></p>
   
   #### Sample Input/Output
   ```
   Input1: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
          ↑         ↓
          7 <- 6 <- 8
   Output1:  1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
   ```

   #### Explanation
   ```
     The detectAndRemoveLoop() function works like a librarian straightening the chain. It finds the person stuck in the loop and gently releases their hand.
After removing the loop, the chain remains the same. People (books) still hold hands in the same order, just without the confusing circle.
Therefore, the output (1->2->3->4->5) represents the straightened chain. It only shows the main line of connected books, not the removed loop.        
   ```
#### Sample Input/Output
   ```
      Input2: A -> B -> C -> D -> E
          ↑         ↓
          G <- F <- H
      Output2: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F -> H
   ```

### December 18 - It's Christmas Season

   #### Problem Statement
   Alice has received a beautiful tree as a gift from her math teacher. This tree has N nodes connected by N-1 edges, and each node is assigned a value represented by arr[i]. Alice enjoys playing with the tree by cutting certain edges and dividing it into multiple subtrees. She has a favorite number X, and she’s curious to find out the number of ways she can cut the tree into subtrees so that the sum of values in each subtree is divisible by X, the cutting order of the edges doesn’t matter.

Help Alice solve this interesting problem by determining the count of good cuttings she can make when dividing the initial tree into 1 subtree, 2 subtree, 3 subtree, and so on, up to N subtrees.

As the number of good cuttings can be huge you need to print the answer modulo 10^9 +7.



   <p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/SVCE-ACM/A-December-Of-Algorithms-2023/assets/153520105/461ad714-e900-4fa0-886c-902d246d0682"></p>

### December 19 - Symbolic Sum

   #### Problem Statement
   Consider a sequence of elements where each element is either a positive integer or a special symbol 'X'. The goal is to calculate the symbolic sum of the sequence, where 'X' is treated as a 
   placeholder for the sum of all the positive integers in the subsequence rooted at that 'X'. Additionally, each 'X' node can have a multiplier associated with it, denoted as 'Xk', where 'k' is a
   positive integer. The 'Xk' node represents the sum of all positive integers in the subsequence rooted at that 'X' multiplied by 'k'. Write a function that takes such a sequence and returns the symbolic sum.

   <p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/SVCE-ACM/A-December-Of-Algorithms-2023/assets/153520105/a555d31f-7645-4981-af36-4c775cdcd446"></p>
   
   #### Sample Input/Output
   ```
   Input-1: [X3, 3, X2, 2, X1, 1, 4]
   Output-1: 49
   ```
   #### Explanation
   ```
  The subsequence rooted at the first 'X3' is the entire sequence, so its sum is 3 + 2 + 1 + 4 = 10, and the multiplier is 3. Therefore, the contribution is 3 * 10 = 30.
  The subsequence rooted at the second 'X2' is the sequence [2, 1, 4], so its sum is 2 + 1 + 4 = 7, and the multiplier is 2. Therefore, the contribution is 2 * 7 = 14.
  The subsequence rooted at the third 'X1' is the sequence [1, 4], so its sum is 1 + 4 = 5, and the multiplier is 1. Therefore, the contribution is 1 * 5 = 5.
  Therefore, the overall symbolic sum is 30 + 14 + 5 = 49.
   ```
  #### Sample Input/Output
  ```
   Input-2: ['X2', 1, 'X3', 2, 3, 'X2', 4, 'X1', 5]
   Output-2: 50
   ```
  ### NOTE:
  The solution to this problem may result in multiple valid outputs based on the formation of the symbolic sum tree. The 
  order in which 'X' nodes are processed and chosen as the root node can influence the tree and, consequently, the final 
  symbolic sum.

  Please be aware that different valid symbolic sum trees may lead to distinct output values.

  Feel free to document and communicate (in the code) your chosen approach for handling the order of node processing in your solution.

  #### Other Possible Outputs:
  ```
   Input-1: [X3, 3, X2, 2, X1, 1, 4]
   Output-1: 49
   Output-1a: 51 [Forming a right-most tree with X3 as root node]
   Output-1b: 33 [Forming a tree with X3 as root node]
   Output-1c: 14 [Forming a right-most tree with X2 as root node]
   ```

### December 20 - Treasure Hunt In The Isles

   #### Problem Statement
   
In the treacherous Cursed Isles, there lies a network of mysterious caves connected by ancient
pathways. Legends speak of hidden treasures guarded by spectral entities. Brave adventurers
seek to navigate this perilous network to uncover the greatest treasure—the Enchanted Diamond.

Your task is to write a function treasure_hunt(graph, start, end) that takes a weighted, directed
graph representing the cave network and finds the safest path from the start cave to the end
cave. However, beware! The caves are cursed, and the weights on the edges not only represent
distances but also the level of ghostly interference. The higher the weight, the more likely
spectral entities are to appear along the way.
To complete the treasure hunt successfully, the adventurer must not only find the shortest path
but also the path with the least interference.


   <p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/SVCE-ACM/A-December-Of-Algorithms-2023/assets/115417933/af96e8c4-d13a-46f4-b0e6-645670c7239a" width="400"></p>
   
   #### Sample Input/Output
   ```
      Input: 
      graph = {
     'Cave_A': {'Cave_B': 3, 'Cave_C': 5},
     'Cave_B': {'Cave_D': 7, 'Cave_E': 1},
     'Cave_C': {'Cave_D': 3},
     'Cave_D': {'Cave_E': 5},
     'Cave_E': {}
     }
     start_cave = 'Cave_A'
     end_cave   = 'Cave_E'

     Output:
      ['Cave_A', 'Cave_B', 'Cave_E']


   ```



   #### Explanation
   ```

	The graph represents the following cave network:
	
	Cave_A --3--> Cave_B --7--> Cave_D --5--> Cave_E
	|       |
	5       1
	|       |
	V       V
	Cave_C --3→
	
	The adventurer starts at Cave_A and seeks to reach Cave_E with the shortest and
	least-interfered path.
	
	The graph is represented as a dictionary where keys are cave names, and values are dictionaries representing neighboring caves and the level of ghostly interference(weights).
	All weights are positive integers.
	Cave names are unique strings.
	The start and end caves are guaranteed to be valid caves in the graph.

        
   ```

   #### Sample Input/Output
   ```
      Input: 
       graph = {
      'Cave_A': {'Cave_B': 4, 'Cave_C': 6},
      'Cave_B': {'Cave_C': 2, 'Cave_D': 5, 'Cave_E': 8},
      'Cave_C': {'Cave_A': 6, 'Cave_D': 7},
      'Cave_D': {'Cave_B': 5, 'Cave_E': 3},
      'Cave_E': {}
      }
      start_cave = 'Cave_B'
      end_cave   = 'Cave_E'

      Output:
       ['Cave_B', 'Cave_D', 'Cave_E']

 ### December 23 - Dominoes 

   #### Problem Statement
   Valera has got n domino pieces in a row. Each piece consists of two halves — the upper one
and the lower one. Each of the halves contains a number from 1 to 6. Valera loves even integers
very much, so he wants the sum of the numbers on the upper halves and the sum of the
numbers on the lower halves to be even.
To do that, Valera can rotate the dominoes by 180 degrees. After the rotation the upper and the
lower halves swap places. This action takes one second. Help Valera find out the minimum time
he must spend rotating dominoes to make his wish come true.
   <p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/SVCE-ACM/A-December-Of-Algorithms-2023/assets/119551893/f9d30e72-a14c-4c1c-baa0-8b33e0a30d3a"></p>

   ```

   #### Explanation
   ```
     In the first test case the sum of the numbers on the upper halves equals 10 and the sum of the numbers on the lower halves equals 6. Both numbers are even, so Valera doesn't required to do
     anything.

### December 24 - Golden Rule Violation

   #### Problem Statement
   Mark loves to arrange things in order. Mark sticks to his “Golden Rule” that every set of numbers must be in ascending order. Unfortunately, that is not always the case. Mark defines a “violation”
   as a situation when a smaller number comes after a larger number in the set, which violates the ascending order. Given a set of integers, help Mark find out the total number of such violations.

   <p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/SVCE-ACM/A-December-Of-Algorithms-2023/assets/153520105/6994ba7f-3f00-45e8-ac01-da88f4e4da94"></p>
   
   #### Sample Input/Output 1
   ```
   Input:
   5
   4 5 6 7 1

   Output: 4
   ```

   #### Explanation
   ```
   The first line refers to the total number of input. 4, 5, 6 and 7 are in order. 1 comes after 4, 5, 6, 7 on the list but is smaller than all 4 of them. Hence 4 is the output.

### December 28 - The Selling Game

   #### Problem Statement
   You are a gadget retailer in Tokyo with x unsold items. Each item g has a performance level m, and a minimum price n. There are z clients interested in purchasing gadgets, and each
   client d has specific criteria: they want an item with a performance level greater than k and a price less than or equal to r. What is the maximum number of gadgets you can sell to the
   clients based on their criteria? Each client can purchase at most one item, and each item can have at most one buyer.
   
   <p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/SVCE-ACM/A-December-Of-Algorithms-2023/assets/153520105/89dbdfea-975f-431a-916e-2b4f844b2360"></p>

   #### Sample Input/Output 1
   ```
   Input:
   x=3
   z=3
   i=[
       {‘k’ : 10, ‘r’ : 100, ‘m’ : 5, ‘n’ : 110},  #Item 0
       {‘k’ : 9, ‘r’ : 200, ‘m’ : 2, ‘n’ : 200},  #Item 1
       {‘k’ : 20, ‘r’ : 300, ‘m’ : 30, ‘n’ : 300}  #Item 2
     ]
  
  c=[
       {‘k’ : 5, ‘r’ : 110},   #client 0
       {‘k’ : 9, ‘r’ : 500},   #client 1
       {‘k’ : 20, ‘r’ : 400},   #client 2
    ] 	

  Output: 2
   ```

   #### Explanation
   ```
   1. Client 0 (desired_performance: 5, max_price: 110): The item with performance 5 and price 110 satisfies the requirements. One gadget is sold.

   2. Client 1 (desired_performance: 9, max_price: 500): The remaining items do not meet the performance requirement, so no additional gadgets are sold.

   3. Client 2 (desired_performance: 20, max_price: 400): The remaining item with performance 30 and price 300 satisfies the requirements. One more gadget is sold.

   Therefore, based on the given input, the maximum number of gadgets that can be sold is 2. The solution efficiently matches items with clients, starting with the items
   with the highest performance and considering clients with the lowest performance requirements first.
   ```
   #### Sample Input/Output 2
   ```
    Input:
    x=4
    z=4
    i=[
      	{‘k’ : 8, ‘r’ : 150, ‘m’ : 10, ‘n’ : 160},  #Item 0
      	{‘k’ : 5, ‘r’ : 180, ‘m’ : 12, ‘n’ : 200},  #Item 1
      	{‘k’ : 20, ‘r’ : 250, ‘m’ : 15, ‘n’ : 300}  #Item 2
      	{‘k’ : 15, ‘r’ : 300, ‘m’ : 18, ‘n’ : 250}  #Item 3
      ]

   c=[
     	{‘k’ : 6, ‘r’ : 200},   #client 0
     	{‘k’ : 14, ‘r’ : 280},   #client 1
     	{‘k’ : 8, ‘r’ : 220},   #client 2
     	{‘k’ : 25, ‘r’ : 350},   #client 3
     ]

    Output: 3
   ```

### December 29 - Cartesian Walk Validator

   #### Problem Statement
   You live in the city of Cartesia where all the roads are laid out in a perfect grid. You arrived ten minutes too early to an appointment, so you decided to take the opportunity to go
   for a short walk. The city provides its citizens with a "Walk Generator" app on their phones every time you press the button, it sends you an array of one letter strings representing
   directions to walk. You always walk only a single block for each letter and you know it takes you 1 minute to traverse one city block, so create a function that will return “TRUE” if
   the walk the app gives you will take you exactly ten minutes and will return you to your starting point. Return “FALSE” otherwise.
   
   <p align="center"><img src="https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/2915843/screenshots/6886074/_2.gif" width = "350"></p>

   #### Sample Input/Output 1
   ```
   Input: walk = ['n', 's', 'n', 's', 'n', 's', 'n', 's', 'n', 's']
   Output: TRUE
   ```

   #### Explanation
   ```
   The function checks if the length of the walk is exactly 10 minutes. Since the length of the input walk is 10, the function proceeds to check if the walk returns you to your starting point.
   The input walk consists of 5 pairs of 'n' and 's' directions, which cancel each other out in terms of north-south movement. Similarly, the input walk consists of 5 pairs of 'e' and 'w' directions,
   which cancel each other out in terms of east-west movement. Therefore, the function returns 'TRUE' as you have returned to your starting point after exactly 10 minutes of walking.
   ```
   #### Sample Input/Output 2
   ```
    Input: walk = ['w', 'e', 'w', 'e', 'w', 'e', 'w', 'e', 'w', 'n']
    Output: FALSE
   ```

### December 30 - Tree Inversions

   #### Problem Statement
   You are given a tree with N nodes and N-1 edges. Each node i of the tree is assigned a color A[i]. Let c(x,y) be the array of colors encountered while traversing from node x to
   node y in the tree in order. Let f(x,y) represent the numbers of inversion in the array c(x,y). Compute f(x,y) + f(y,x) for Q different queries. Inversions in array 'arr[]' are equal to
   the count of pairs (i,j) such that i < j and arr[i] > arr[j]. A tree is a graph with N nodes and N-1 edges such that it is possible to travel from any node to any other node.

   
   <p align="center"><img src="https://shorturl.at/afxOZ" width = "350"></p>

   #### Input Format
   First line of the input contains an integer T, representing the number of test cases.
   The first line of each test case contains 2 space-separated integers N, Q representing the number of nodes and the number of queries respectively.
   The next line of each test case contains N integers separated by a space representing array A, the array of colors.
   Next N-1 lines of each test case contains 2 integers space-separated integers X,Y each (X,Y), representing that there’s an edge between node X to node Y.
   The next Q lines of each test case contains 2 space-separated integers x,y each (x,y) representing the queries.

   #### Output Format
   For each query output the answer in a new line representing the value f(x,y) + f(y,x).
	  
   #### Constraints
   ```
   1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5
   2 ≤ N, Q ≤ 10^5
   1 ≤ A[i] ≤ N
   1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5
   1 ≤ X, Y ≤ N, X ≠ Y
   1 ≤ x, y ≤ N, x ≠ y
   ```

   #### Sample Input/Output
   ```
   Input:
   1
   8 7
   1 2 3 1 2 1 3 1
   1 2
   1 3
   2 4

   4 8

   Output:
   7 
   8
   8
   5
   2
   1
   9
   ```

   #### Explanation
   ```
     In this sample, an 8-node tree is described, each node with a distinct color. The output values for queries between nodes 4 and 6, 7 and 8, 5 and 4, 7 and 6, 3 and 8, 1 and 2, and 4 and 8 
     are 7, 8, 8, 5, 2, 1, and 9, respectively. These counts are derived by traversing the tree and comparing colors along the specified paths.

FAQ
======

#### Who can join the Challenge?
Anyone who is passionate about coding and can dedicate a little time a day for the challenge for the next 31 days.

#### When should I submit the pull request?
You don't need to submit it everyday. Just submit it once you're done with all 31 algorithms.

#### What if I'm not able to code every day?
Not a problem. While coding every day is nice, we understand that other commitments might interfere with it. 

Plus its holiday season. So you don't have to solve one problem every day. 

Go at your own pace. One per day or 7 a week or even all 30 in a day.

#### What language should I use to code?
Anything! New to GoLang? Best way to practice it. 

Wanna find out what all this hype about Python is? Use it! 

Any and all languages are welcome. 

Maybe you could try using a different language for every problem as a mini-challenge?

#### Fork? Pull request? What is all that? I don't know how to use GitHub!
If you are new to Git or GitHub, check out this out [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

#### Where are the rest of the problems?
Our code ninjas are hard at work preparing the rest of the problems. Don't worry, they'll be up soon.

#### How should I complete these programs?
We have a folder for each day of the month. Simply complete your code and move the file into that folder. 

Be sure to rename your file to the following format: `language_username` or `language_username_problemname`
Some examples:
`python3_exampleUser.py`
`c_exampleUser.c`

**Please do not modify any existing files in the repository.**

#### I forked the repository but some problems were added only after that. How do I access those problems?
Not to worry! Open your nearest terminal or command prompt and navigate over to your forked repository. 

Enter these commands:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/SVCE-ACM/A-December-of-Algorithms-2023.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```
If you're curious, the commands simply add a new remote called upstream that is linked to this repository. Then it 'fetches' or retrieves the contents of the repository and attempts to merge it with your progress.
Note that if you've already added the upstream repository, you don't need to re-add it in the future while fetching the newer questions.

#### I received a merge error. What do I do?
This shouldn't happen unless you modify an existing file in the repository. There's a lot of potential troubleshooting that might be needed, but the simplest thing to do is to make a copy of your code outside the repository and then clone it once again. Now repeat the steps from the answer above. Merge it and then add your code. Now proceed as usual. :)

#### I'm facing difficulties with/need help understanding a particular question.
Open up an [issue](https://github.com/SVCE-ACM/A-December-of-Algorithms-2021/issues) on this repository and we'll do our best to help you out.
