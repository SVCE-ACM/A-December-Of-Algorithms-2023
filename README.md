   ```
       1. "cat" to "cot":
             Only one letter changes ("a" to "o").
             This adheres to the rule that the words in the chain must differ by exactly one letter.
       2. "cot" to "dot":
             Again, only one letter changes ("c" to "d").
             The chain is still follows the rule of a single-letter difference between consecutive words.
       3. "dot" to "dog":
             Just like before, only one letter changes ("t" to "g").
       4. "dog" to "cog":
             Once more, only one letter changes ("d" to "c").

   ```
#### Sample Input/Output
   ```
     Input: ["apple", "orange", "banana", "grape", "peach"]
     Output: No valid chain.

### December 16 - Outbreak Dynamics

   #### Problem Statement
   In a grid representing a city, there are zombies and humans. Zombies can infect humans in adjacent cells (up, down, left, or right), turning them into zombies. However, zombies cannot cross obstacles represented by the value -1. Humans can move freely. Implement a function to calculate the minimum time it takes for the zombie infection to spread throughout the entire city. If it's not possible for the infection to spread to all humans, return -1.The city is represented as a 2D grid, where:

0 represents an empty cell (can be occupied by a human),
1 represents a cell with a zombie,
-1 represents an obstacle.

   #### Sample Input/Output
   ```
      Input 1:
grid = [
    [0, 1, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 1, 1],
    [0, 1, -1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0]
]

Output: 3
   ```

   #### Explanation
   ```
     For Input 1:
In this example, it takes 3 minutes for the zombie infection to spread to all humans. The path is as follows:

1.Minute 1: Zombies in (0, 1) and (1, 0) infect humans in (0, 0) and (1, 1).
2.Minute 2: Zombies in (1, 2) and (1, 3) infect humans in (0, 2), (1, 2), and (2, 2).
3.Minute 3: Zombies in (2, 1) and (2, 3) infect humans in (2, 0), (2, 1), and (2, 2).
        
   ```
#### Sample Input/Output
   ```
      Input 2:
grid = [
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, -1, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
]
Output: 4

   ``` 
   
   #### Explanation
   ```
     For Input 2:
Minute 1: Zombies in (0, 0) and (2, 0) infect humans in (0, 1) and (1, 0).
Minute 2: Zombies in (0, 2) and (2, 2) infect humans in (0, 0), (0, 2), (1, 1), and (1, 3).
Minute 3: Zombies in (0, 3) and (2, 3) infect humans in (1, 2), (2, 1), and (2, 2).
Minute 4: Zombies in (0, 4), (1, 4), and (4, 4) infect humans in (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), and (4, 3).

### December 17 - Bookshelf Dilemma

   #### Problem Statement
   Imagine you're a librarian in a busy city library. A visitor complains about confusing loops in certain book sections. Create a function called detectAndRemoveLoop(). Swiftly, you navigate the shelves, untangling and fixing loops. The books now sit neatly, providing an orderly reading experience for visitors. This tool proves invaluable in maintaining the library's organization. Create a linked list that detects and removes the loops.



   <p align="center"><img src = "https://github.com/SVCE-ACM/A-December-Of-Algorithms-2023/assets/153520105/3378af05-944d-4e9c-b3e1-cf53e5bccac9"></p>
   
   #### Sample Input/Output
   ```
   Input1: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
          ↑         ↓
          7 <- 6 <- 8
   Output1:  1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
   ```

   #### Explanation
   ```
     The detectAndRemoveLoop() function works like a librarian straightening the chain. It finds the person stuck in the loop and gently releases their hand.
After removing the loop, the chain remains the same. People (books) still hold hands in the same order, just without the confusing circle.
Therefore, the output (1->2->3->4->5) represents the straightened chain. It only shows the main line of connected books, not the removed loop.        
   ```
#### Sample Input/Output
   ```
      Input2: A -> B -> C -> D -> E
          ↑         ↓
          G <- F <- H
      Output2: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F -> H
   ```

### December 18 - It's Christmas Season

   #### Problem Statement
   Alice has received a beautiful tree as a gift from her math teacher. This tree has N nodes connected by N-1 edges, and each node is assigned a value represented by arr[i]. Alice enjoys playing with the tree by cutting certain edges and dividing it into multiple subtrees. She has a favorite number X, and she’s curious to find out the number of ways she can cut the tree into subtrees so that the sum of values in each subtree is divisible by X, the cutting order of the edges doesn’t matter.

Help Alice solve this interesting problem by determining the count of good cuttings she can make when dividing the initial tree into 1 subtree, 2 subtree, 3 subtree, and so on, up to N subtrees.

As the number of good cuttings can be huge you need to print the answer modulo 10^9 +7.



   <p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/SVCE-ACM/A-December-Of-Algorithms-2023/assets/153520105/461ad714-e900-4fa0-886c-902d246d0682"></p>

   #### Input and Output Constraints
   ```
INPUT FORMAT:
 
. The first line of the input contains an integer T, representing the number of test cases.
. The first line of each test case contains 2 integers , N, X.
. Next line of each test case contains N integers separated by a space, representing the array arr.
. The next N-1 lines of each test case contain 2 integers each, representing an edge of the tree.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

. For each test case, output N integers separated by space telling the count of good cuttings when divided the tree into 1 subtree, 2 subtree, 3 subtree and so on up to  N subtrees.
```

1 4 6 4 1
   ```

   #### Explanation
   ```
In the first test case;
. to divide the initial tree into 2 subtrees the possible set of edges which can be removed are:
  . {(1,2)}
  . {(1,3)}
. to divide the initial tree into 3 subtrees the possible set of edges which can be removed are:
  . {(1,2),(1,3)}

### December 19 - Symbolic Sum

   #### Problem Statement
   Consider a sequence of elements where each element is either a positive integer or a special symbol 'X'. The goal is to calculate the symbolic sum of the sequence, where 'X' is treated as a 
   placeholder for the sum of all the positive integers in the subsequence rooted at that 'X'. Additionally, each 'X' node can have a multiplier associated with it, denoted as 'Xk', where 'k' is a
   positive integer. The 'Xk' node represents the sum of all positive integers in the subsequence rooted at that 'X' multiplied by 'k'. Write a function that takes such a sequence and returns the symbolic sum.

   <p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/SVCE-ACM/A-December-Of-Algorithms-2023/assets/153520105/a555d31f-7645-4981-af36-4c775cdcd446"></p>
   
   #### Sample Input/Output
   ```
   Input-1: [X3, 3, X2, 2, X1, 1, 4]
   Output-1: 49
   ```
   #### Explanation
   ```
  The subsequence rooted at the first 'X3' is the entire sequence, so its sum is 3 + 2 + 1 + 4 = 10, and the multiplier is 3. Therefore, the contribution is 3 * 10 = 30.
  The subsequence rooted at the second 'X2' is the sequence [2, 1, 4], so its sum is 2 + 1 + 4 = 7, and the multiplier is 2. Therefore, the contribution is 2 * 7 = 14.
  The subsequence rooted at the third 'X1' is the sequence [1, 4], so its sum is 1 + 4 = 5, and the multiplier is 1. Therefore, the contribution is 1 * 5 = 5.
  Therefore, the overall symbolic sum is 30 + 14 + 5 = 49.
   ```
  #### Sample Input/Output
  ```
   Input-2: ['X2', 1, 'X3', 2, 3, 'X2', 4, 'X1', 5]
   Output-2: 50
   ```

FAQ
======

#### Who can join the Challenge?
Anyone who is passionate about coding and can dedicate a little time a day for the challenge for the next 31 days.

#### When should I submit the pull request?
You don't need to submit it everyday. Just submit it once you're done with all 31 algorithms.

#### What if I'm not able to code every day?
Not a problem. While coding every day is nice, we understand that other commitments might interfere with it. 

Plus its holiday season. So you don't have to solve one problem every day. 

Go at your own pace. One per day or 7 a week or even all 30 in a day.

#### What language should I use to code?
Anything! New to GoLang? Best way to practice it. 

Wanna find out what all this hype about Python is? Use it! 

Any and all languages are welcome. 

Maybe you could try using a different language for every problem as a mini-challenge?

#### Fork? Pull request? What is all that? I don't know how to use GitHub!
If you are new to Git or GitHub, check out this out [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

#### Where are the rest of the problems?
Our code ninjas are hard at work preparing the rest of the problems. Don't worry, they'll be up soon.

#### How should I complete these programs?
We have a folder for each day of the month. Simply complete your code and move the file into that folder. 

Be sure to rename your file to the following format: `language_username` or `language_username_problemname`
Some examples:
`python3_exampleUser.py`
`c_exampleUser.c`

**Please do not modify any existing files in the repository.**

#### I forked the repository but some problems were added only after that. How do I access those problems?
Not to worry! Open your nearest terminal or command prompt and navigate over to your forked repository. 

Enter these commands:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/SVCE-ACM/A-December-of-Algorithms-2023.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```
If you're curious, the commands simply add a new remote called upstream that is linked to this repository. Then it 'fetches' or retrieves the contents of the repository and attempts to merge it with your progress.
Note that if you've already added the upstream repository, you don't need to re-add it in the future while fetching the newer questions.

#### I received a merge error. What do I do?
This shouldn't happen unless you modify an existing file in the repository. There's a lot of potential troubleshooting that might be needed, but the simplest thing to do is to make a copy of your code outside the repository and then clone it once again. Now repeat the steps from the answer above. Merge it and then add your code. Now proceed as usual. :)

#### I'm facing difficulties with/need help understanding a particular question.
Open up an [issue](https://github.com/SVCE-ACM/A-December-of-Algorithms-2021/issues) on this repository and we'll do our best to help you out.
